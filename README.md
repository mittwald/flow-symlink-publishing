Advanced Symlink publishing for Flow and Neos
=============================================

This package provides advanced symlink publishing options for Flow and Neos.
Most importantly, this package adds the option to publish resources using relative symlinks.
This is important when you run Flow or Neos with a chrooted PHP interpreter.

Installation
------------

Install using composer:

    composer require mittwald-flow/symlink-publishing

Next delete all absolute referenced symlinks, etc., from the _Resources folder:

    rm -rf Web/_Resources

Finally reissue the relative referenced symlinks, etc.:

    ./flow resource:publish

Configuration
-------------

You can configure relative symlink publishing in the Flow settings.
**It is enabled by default!**

	TYPO3:
	  Flow:
		resource:
		  targets:
			localWebDirectoryPersistentResourcesTarget:
			  target: 'Mw\SymlinkPublishing\Resource\Target\FileSystemSymlinkTarget'
			  targetOptions:
				  relativeSymlinks: TRUE
			localWebDirectoryStaticResourcesTarget:
			  target: 'Mw\SymlinkPublishing\Resource\Target\FileSystemSymlinkTarget'
			  targetOptions:
				  relativeSymlinks: TRUE


### Change Flow root path

If you change the FLOW_ROOTPATH (for exmaple you use the TYPO3/Surf deployment) and your webserver documentRoot is a other one as the FLOW_ROOTPATH, you have to change the **path** options at the **resource** -> **targets** -> **targetOptions**
from '%FLOW_PATH_WEB%' to '%FLOW_PATH_ROOT%'.

Add following to your global or site package Settings.yaml

	TYPO3:
	  Flow:
		resource:
		  targets:
			localWebDirectoryPersistentResourcesTarget:
			  targetOptions:
				  path: '%FLOW_PATH_ROOT%Web/_Resources/Persistent/'
			localWebDirectoryStaticResourcesTarget:
			  targetOptions:
				  path: '%FLOW_PATH_ROOT%Web/_Resources/Static/Packages/'
